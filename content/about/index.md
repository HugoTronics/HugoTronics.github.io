I'm Hugo, a French hobbyist passionate about RF electronics, 3D design, and 3D printing. I've been working for the French Army for nearly 7 years, where I have cultivated a deep interest in technology. I enjoy exploring the world of radio frequencies, experimenting with circuits, and turning ideas into tangible objects with 3D printing.

On this site, I share my experiences and projects related to RF electronics, 3D design, and 3D printing. Whether you're an enthusiast or just curious about these areas, I invite you to join me as I delve into these exciting fields. I hope you find the insights and projects shared here both useful and inspiring!

Here are some photos of my different projects !
